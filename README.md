# Tennis Ace

## Overview

This project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project we’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements.

## Project Goals

We will create a linear regression model that predicts the outcome for a tennis player based on their playing habits. By analyzing and modeling the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) data, we will determine what it takes to be one of the best tennis players in the world.


## Action

- Perform exploratory analysis on the data by plotting different features against the different outcomes. 
- Use one feature from the dataset to build a single feature linear regression model on the data.
- Create a few more linear regression models that use one feature to predict one of the outcomes.
- Create a few linear regression models that use two features to predict yearly earnings. 
- Create a few linear regression models that use multiple features to predict yearly earnings.

## Data Source

The dataset is provided in `tennis_stats.csv` is data from the men’s professional tennis league, which is called the [ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals)](https://www.atptour.com/). Data from the top 1500 ranked players in the ATP over the span of 2009 to 2017 are provided in file. The statistics recorded for each player in each year include service game (offensive) statistics, return game (defensive) statistics and outcomes.
